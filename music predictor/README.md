# Music Recommender Model

## Overview
This project is a simple music recommender model that predicts your music taste based on your age and gender. While this is not a comprehensive representation of music preferences, it serves as a starter project to understand machine learning models. The model is built using a Decision Tree Classifier.

## Features
- Predicts music preferences based on age and gender.
- Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier for predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [[https://github.com/Gitau189/music-recommender-model.git](https://github.com/Gitau189/music-recommender-model)](https://github.com/Gitau189/music-recommender-model)
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd music-recommender-model
   ```
3. Install the required libraries:


## Usage
1. Ensure you have the necessary CSV files in the project directory.
2. Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model.

## Data
The model uses a dataset that includes age, gender, and music preferences. The data sources will be uploaded for viewing.



## Limitations
- The model's predictions are based solely on age and gender, which are not comprehensive indicators of music taste.
- This project is intended for educational purposes and may not provide accurate recommendations.
